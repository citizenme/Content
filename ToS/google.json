We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance”</em>. Today, these limitations of time are gone from the Privacy Policy, although <a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=162743\">some pages</a> still acknowledge this.
