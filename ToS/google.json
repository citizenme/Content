We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance”. Today, these limitations of time are gone from the Privacy Policy, although some pages still acknowledge this. So we must conclude that Google has decided to stop trying to find the right balance between privacy of users and their own needs."
